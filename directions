// The table/game looks like Rob made it. Change this.
// What about those stupid 11, 12, 13?
// What about Aces?
// The player can hit forever?
// There is no win counter/bet system
// There is no "deck" to draw from
// The cards aren't red or black like they should/could be
// The cards are lame. Find images.
// There is no delay on showing the cards... it's instant. 
// You can see the dealers 2nd card on deal. That's unfair (to the house).
